* intro

these /.files/ have accompanied me since /2019/-ish (under VC since 2020), the
files (scripts) are written with portability in mind, meaning they're meant to
work across multiple [[https://0x0.st/HNfM][*nix distrubutions]].

* installation

somewhere around early /2022/ i switched from a bare git repo to using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]
to properly sync *.files*.

* disclaimer

this repository serves as a laboratory. it's meant for experimentation and

sharing is always encouraged.

section designed to only track *very remarkable* stuff.

/(descending by date)/

*2022-05-08* - mass repo cleanup

- due to bad practices, this repo was filled with large blobs of files
  by the extentions ={png,ttf,otf}= (stored a few wallpapers + fonts).  *these
  blobs were pruned at the cost of the whole commit history being rewritten*.

*2022-04-26* - switch to /GNU Stow/.

- this repository literally emulated the structure of a =~/= directory
  prior to the switch.

*2021-06-02* - License switch /GPLv2/ -> /GPLv3/.

*2020-11-14* - /GNU Emacs/ is introduced.
