* Introduction

The journey begins around 2019-ish, back when I was a complete novice in the
/*nix/ world. The way I used to manage my configurations originally was by
emulating the =~/= directory structure in the git repository; plain =cp=.  *Luke
Smith* was the individual who introduced me the /*nix/ world via his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB6UWGeNePk][humurous]],

any /libre-whatever/ platform. More on this on the [[Acknoledgments][Acknoledgments]] section.

** Dotfile Configuration Systems (stow, chezmoi, ansible, ...)

After some time using a traditional approach to manage my configurations I went
on and tried [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]], which is a symlink farm manager. It was nice being able
to edit the managed configuration files the normal way to also affecting the
source files.

/Stow/ did not last long before I tried [[https://www.chezmoi.io/][chezmoi]] for even less time. It offered
me everything /Stow/ did but with the added benefit of being able to use
placeholders and templates, among other few things.

I settled using [[https://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] for a while, which is a configuration management tool
developed by *RedHat*. This convinced me to believe this project was more solid
than the previously mentioned ones, because of *RedHat* being a big company.
And in fact, it is true, until this day I still recommend using /Ansible/ even
though I do not use it anymore.

I transformed my whole configuration into /Ansible/ playbooks, which gave a lot
of flexibility and the ability to not only manage my configurations, but also to
install some programs. This ended up reducing a lot manual intervention I had to
deal with previously. To accomplish this, I followed *LearnLinuxTV*'s excellent
