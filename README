* intro

these /.files/ have accompanied me since *2019*ish (under VC since 2020), the
files (scripts) are written with portability in mind, meaning they're meant to
work across multiple [[https://0x0.st/HNfM][*nix distrubutions]].

* disclaimer

this repository serves as a laboratory. it's meant for experimentation and
should be considered /unstable/, /biased/ and sometimes even /untested/.

nevertheless feel free to take a look and learn from it, experimenting and
sharing is always encouraged.

* installation

as of right i'm not using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] or any other fancy tool for deploying these.

get the repo:

#+begin_src shell
git clone --depth 1 'https://gitlab.com/anntnzrb/_nixrice.git' '/tmp/annt-nixrice'
#+end_src

install @ =~/=:

*NOTE*: /this will overwrite your existing files under your home folder./

#+begin_src shell
cp -Rf "/tmp/annt-nixrice/." "${HOME}/"
