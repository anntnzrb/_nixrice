#  Preample

# This =i3= setup is meant to be used along with [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]]. The =i3-msg= command allows
# sending =i3= commands which can be bounded to certain keys with the program
# mentioned earlier.

# + [[Reference https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html
# ][i3 User Guide]]

# This line below needs to be part of the configuration file, unsure why, but
# adding it solved many issues.


# i3 config file (v4)

# Core Settings

# These settings belong to =i3= (=~/.config/i3/config=), the rest (mostly) should be
# keybind related which is handled separetely with =sxhkd=
# (=~/.config/i3/sxhkdrc_i3=).

# Variables

# Declaration of variables, some settings may be configured from here so it's
# easier to edit than finding the sections.

# The syntax for =set=-ting variables is a bit strange, haven't done much research,
# but I'd prefer quotting instead of having white-spaces.
