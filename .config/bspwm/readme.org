* window manager

** preamble

=bspwm='s configuration file (=bspwmrc=) must be an executable file; this comment
will be appended in order to create the file itself

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc :shebang "#!/bin/sh\n"
# annt's bspwm's
#+end_src

*** environment

declaration of variables to be used

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
# window manager
BSPWM_PATH="$HOME/.config/bspwm"
BSPWM_CFG="$BSPWM_PATH/bspwmrc"

# keybinds
BSPWM_BINDS="$BSPWM_PATH/sxhkdrc_bspc"

# bar
BSPWM_BAR="$BSPWM_PATH/succaderc_bspwm"
#+end_src

** autostart

these applications are meant to be ran in the background in order to complement
the window manager; in order to make configurations generic, it is best to place
all =Xorg= related stuff at =~/.xinitrc= & =~/.xprofile=, but in this case the hotkeys
and bar are strictly for =bspwm=, so it is fine to leave them here

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
# keybinds
sxhkd -c "$BSPWM_BINDS" &

#bar
succade -c "$BSPWM_BAR" &
#+end_src

** screens

i dislike sharing workspaces between monitors, meaning i prefer =n= amount of
workspaces /per monitor/; this =for= loop creates =9= workspaces for each monitor
found

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
for mon in $(bspc query -M --names); do
    bspc monitor "$mon" -d $(seq -ws ' ' 1 9)
done
#+end_src

** general settings

these are the most general settings, they do not correspond to any specific
section

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
# nodes/windows
bspc config pointer_modifier      "mod4"
bspc config focus_follows_pointer true
bspc config pointer_follows_focus true

# monitors
bspc config remove_disabled_monitors  true
bspc config remove_unplugged_monitors true
#+end_src

** rules

rules for the behaviour of applications

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
# reset configuration
bspc rule -r "*"

# app rules
bspc rule -a "Lutris:*:*" state=floating
bspc rule -a "MultiMC5:*:*" state=floating rectangle=960x600+500+250
#+end_src

** appearance

*** colors

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
bspc config normal_border_color  "#696969"
bspc config active_border_color  "#696969"
bspc config focused_border_color "#800000"
#+end_src

*** borders & gaps

how nodes are presented

#+begin_src sh :tangle bspwmrc
# borders
bspc config border_width   3
bspc config top_padding    32
bspc config bottom_padding 0
bspc config left_padding   0
bspc config right_padding  0

# gaps
bspc config window_gap 30
#+end_src

* keybinds

** focusing

*** monitors

cycle thru monitors

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + ctrl + bracket{left,right}
  bspc monitor {prev,next} -f
#+end_src

*** workspaces

some environments have different names for this, =tags=, =desktops= or just
=workspaces=, even tho they are not exactly the same, they accomplish the same
behavior most of the time

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + {1-9}
  bspc desktop -f 'focused:^{1-9}'
#+end_src
*** nodes

focus between nodes using =vi= keybinds

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + {h,j,k,l}
  bspc node -f {west,south,north,east}
#+end_src

** moving & resizing

*** moving nodes

swap position of nodes

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + {h,j,k,l}
  bspc node -s {west,south,north,east}
#+end_src

move node to =n= monitor

+ ={1-9}= is arbitrary set (/i don't have that many monitors/), it may be =n= amount of monitors

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + alt + {1-9}
  bspc node -m '^{1-9}'
#+end_src

move nodes to =n= workspace

+ =n= is locked to the amount of workspaces (/desktops/) declared at [[preamble]]

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + {1-9}
  bspc node -d 'focused:^{1-9}'
#+end_src

*** resizing nodes

expand/contract outwards/inwards

+ after the =super + shift + r= chord, hold any of these keys to expand a node by moving one of its side outwards:
 + =h= :: left outwards
 + =j= :: down outwards
 + =k= :: up outwards
 + =l= :: right outwards

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + r : {h,j,k,l}
  bspc node -z {left -20 0,bottom 0 20,top 0 -20,right 20 0}
#+end_src

+ after the =super + shift + r= chord, hold any of these keys to contract a node by moving one of its side inwards:
 + =h= :: left inwards
 + =j= :: down inwards
 + =k= :: up inwards
 + =l= :: right inwards

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + alt + r : {h,j,k,l}
  bspc node -z {right -20 0,top 0 20,bottom 0 -20,left 20 0}
#+end_src

*** resizing gaps

gap presets

+ after the =super + shift + g= chord, hold either:
 + =\= :: set gaps to =0=
 + =-= :: set gaps to =5=
 + === :: set gaps to =75=

defaults can be found at [[borders & gaps]]

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + g : {backslash,minus,equal}
  bspc config window_gap {0,5,75}
#+end_src

dynamic increase & decrease gaps

+ after the =super + shift + g= chord, hold either:
 + ={= :: to decrease gaps
 + =}= :: to increase gaps

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + g : bracket{left,right}
  bspc config window_gap "$(($(bspc config -d focused window_gap) {-,+} 5 ))"
#+end_src

** layouts

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + t ; {m,t}
  bspc desktop -l {monocle,tiled}
#+end_src

** controls

*** closing nodes

+ =-c= correctly closes the focused frame
+ =-k= forces killing the frame (unsafe, but sometimes required)

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + q ; {q,k}
  bspc node -{c,k}
#+end_src

*** restarting bspwm

alternatively, the =Xorg= server may be terminated to end a =bspwm= session

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + q ; r
  bspc wm -r
#+end_src

** states

+ =f= - full-screen
+ =space= - floating

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + s ; {f,space}
  bspc node -t '~{fullscreen,floating}'
#+end_src

** flags

+ =x= - cannot be closed
+ =s= - stays focused across workspaces
+ =p= - keeps the same tiling position/size

#+begin_src sh :tangle sxhkdrc_bspc
super + shift + f ; {x,s,p}
  bspc node -g {locked,sticky,private}
#+end_src

* reload configuration

** bspwm

=bspwm= can be restarted to reload its config with =wm= /domain/ in some case you
might need to terminate the =Xorg= server for changes to apply effectively

+ restart bspwm

#+begin_src sh
bspc wm -r
#+end_src

+ terminate the =X= server

#+begin_src sh
pkill -15 "Xorg"
#+end_src

** sxhkd

=sxhkd= reloads upon receiving signal =USR1=

#+begin_src sh
pkill -USR1 "sxhkd"
#+end_src
* acknoledgements

the man pages of both =bspwm= & =sxhkd= are very well documented; nevertheless these
are good resources i came across in my configuring journey

** Protesilaos Stavrou

his book [[https://protesilaos.com/pdfd/][Prot's Dots For Debian]] covers how to install =bspwm= and documents its
usage and workflow very well

** Brodie Robertson

[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRjzjpJ02WDP7wkGi5FptXM7axEcVy0-W][his playlist]] covers enough to get started with both =bspwm= & =sxhkd=
