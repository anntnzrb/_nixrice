Shell Utilities
===============
Set of utility scripts used across the system.

These scripts are meant to be portable across UNIX-like systems by following
the POSIX standards.

Scripts should be checked with shellcheck <https://www.shellcheck.net/>.
The recommended flags are the following

    shellcheck -o 'all' <file>

Portable Shell scripting is detailed by GNU autoconf
